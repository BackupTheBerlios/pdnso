PublicDNS.org DNS management system.
    PublicDNS.org is a web based DNS management system. It currently runs
    www.public-dns.org, which offers free public dns and url redirection
    services.

    This project provides everything needed to run such a site, including
    backend code which cooperates with BIND, various daemons, and the front
    end. It does need a database (MySQL currently supported), DNS server
    (BIND currently supported), webserver that can run cgi scripts, and the
    ability to run sripts on the server and on the dns servers.

    Version 2.001 is the initial public release of the source code for
    PublicDNS.org.

    Documentation is currently in poor state, but should be adaquate to
    getting this distribution up and running. The codebase has been used in
    a production environment for thousands of domains for several years.

    Of the documentation we do have, an overview of the workflow is
    available in html/process.htm, there is online help built into the
    system, and the install documentation (docs/INSTALL.pod) is fairly
    complete.

    Please note, a complete re-write is currently underway. This version was
    put out there in order to "light a fire under our buts" :-) We had
    intended to release this under the GPL years ago, but wanted to do a
    complete re-write first. Of course, since it was running fine as is, we
    put off re-writing it, and thus put off releasing it. So, in the end
    (now), we've decided to do as few updates as possible in order to be
    able to re-distribute the codebase.

BUGS
    All known bugs should be visable in our bug tracker:

        https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=5359

    However, a few important ones to point out that you should be aware
    of...

    * Installing to a subdirectory
        Installation to a subdirectory of a site has not been fully tested,
        but should work. Eg. installing to
        http://your.domain.com/some/dir/pdnso/

        Please let us know if you have either success or failure with this.

    * url_redirect.d dies randomly
        url_redirect.d - This dies every once in a while. I haven't been
        able to determine what the cause is. Sometimes it'll run for months
        without an issue, othertimes just a few days. My guess is, someone
        is throwing some really nasty data at it, and it's not coping with
        that very well.
