	ownership of the domain.

DNS Record Limitations:
-----------------------
	records may only contain the following characters:
		A-Z a-z 0-9 period(.) dash(-)
	neither domains nor records may start with nor end with dash(-)
	invalid characters will be stripped before attempting to process them.
	domains (including the .com type extension) have a max length of 63 characters
	records, including the full domain, have a max lenth of 255 characters
DNS Record Automatic Interpretation:
------------------------------------
	When entering a record, public-dns will attempt to figure out what the
	record should really be.
	For example, assuming your domain is "mydomain.com":
		www will be interpreted as:
			www.mydomain.com.
		www.test.com will be interpreted as:
			www.test.com.mydomain.com.
		www.test.com. will be interpreted as:
			www.test.com.mydomain.com.
		www.mydomain.com will be interpreted as:
			www.mydomain.com.
		www.mydomain.com. will be interpreted as:
			www.mydomain.com.

Record Explainations:
---------------------
	A  : Address records. Points domain records (ie. www.mydomain.com.)
	     directly to IP addresses (ie. 192.168.0.1)
	MX : Mail Exchanger records. Points domain records (ie. mydomain.com.)
	     to mail servers in order to direct mail for the domain record
	     to the mail server. The mail server entered must be a domain
	     record itself that is an A record (like mail.mydomain.com.)
	     and must end in a period.
	CNAME : Canonical Name records. Points domain records (ie. www.mydomain.com.)
	        to other domain records (ie. mydomain.com.).
	        The domain record you are pointing to may even exist in another
	        domain (ie. someoneelsesdomain.com.).
	        CNAMEs must point to records that are A records.
	NS : Name Server records. Informs of what name servers are authoritive
	     for domain. ie.
			mydomain.com. IN NS dns1.public-dns.net.
	TXT : Text records. Points domain records (ie. info.mydomain.com.)
	      to any string of text (under 256 characters). ie.
	      	info.mydomain.com. IN TXT "owned by John Smith"
	HINFO : Host Info records. Points domain records (ie. www.mydomain.com.)
	        to information about a host. You can enter any arbitrary text
	        into each of the two fields (under 256 characters per field).
	        History: Before MX records, HINFO records were used to
	        determin were the domains mail server was located. ie.
	        	mydomain.com. IN HINFO "mail server" "smtp.server.com:25"
	Other Types : DNS supports other types of records as well.
	              public-dns currently doesn't support any other types
	              however, if you require the use of some other record type,
	              just let us know at support@Public-DNS.org and we'll
	              get it added.
