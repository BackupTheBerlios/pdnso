TODO

This is by no means an exhaustive list of all todo items... just some
important ones to note.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIX HARDCODED PATHS
-------------------
grep for /usr/local... make those configurable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNIFY PRIVACY POLICY LINKS
--------------------------
The privacy policy is linked to as both /index.html?section=privacypolicy and
/privacypolicy.htm. Need to unify them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUDIT FOR NON-RELATIVE LINKS
----------------------------
The system needs an audit to search for any links that begin with a slash "/".
They'll need updated with a relative link. Most (maybe all of them) were 
removed after a grep for '=/' and '="/', but there could be others still
there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RE-WRITE process.htm
--------------------
This script currently is NOT linked to, but has a good overview of how the 
system works. Re-write it as a template, and link it from the help section
or something.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation
-------------
Document the backend and frontend more completely, especially the individual
scripts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACT TIMESPANS
------------------
Move all timespans to the config, like, how long a pending domains stay in
queue.
Move minimum times for SOA records into the config (add a validation check to
PublicDNS::Utils.pm).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFACTOR UTILS
--------------
There are a lot of calls that should be factored out to utility modules.
Sub check_roots() (from check_pending_domains.cron and test_domain.pl).
All daemon calls should go through a module w/ an API.
Sub delete_domain() from find_lame_domains.cron (and from the frontend equiv).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DATA VALIDATION
---------------
Some of the library subroutines could use some data validation. eg. pdsysd.pl
sub addzonefile() should check that $pdinput is an array ref.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FRONT END UTILITY VALIDATION
----------------------------
Add value checking to value side of add's/mod's (so they don't leave off
period and such) (we may already have this one done, needs verified)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COOKIE REFACTORING
------------------
Cookies - check if they are accepting them solution: From all pages (possibly
just modifying out auth login routine) set an additional cookie
"has_cookie_support". Then, when checking re-authentication, if that isn't
set, then they haven't been to any pages at all or aren't accepting cookies.
We can then figure out from the lack of that cookie and checking out existing
sessions whether or not they accept cookies, and respond accordingly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TZ SUPPORT
----------
There are some hardcoded TZ specific things within the code. For example, 
in url_redirect.d, it has a REALLY broken chunk of code:

    my ($sec,$min,$hr,$day,$mon,$year) = localtime(time + (5*60*60)); # adjust to GMT

It's doesn't really break anything, but it's just wrong.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
URL REDIRECT APACHE MODULE
--------------------------
Instead of running a separate daemon to handle url redirects, which requires
its own IP, an apache module could be a nice alternative. I'd want to keep
both active, as the standalone one would still work if the user wasn't running
apache.
